## Overview

This repository contains comprehensive research examining the gap between political rhetoric and policy implementation in the United States across key domestic issues. The analysis reveals how politicians' public commitments on major problems often diverge significantly from their actual policy actions, and the consequences this has for public trust and governance.

## üìë Key Topics Covered

- **Healthcare**: Analysis of unfulfilled promises in healthcare reform and prescription drug pricing, and why ambitious coverage proposals regularly fall short.
  
- **Homelessness**: Examination of the disconnect between compassionate rhetoric about ending homelessness and the growing crisis on the streets of America.
  
- **Addiction and Opioid Crisis**: How public health framing in speeches contrasts with insufficient funding and continued criminalization approaches.
  
- **Education**: The persistent gap between "children first" rhetoric and chronic underinvestment in schools, teacher salaries, and higher education affordability.
  
- **National Debt**: The contradiction between fiscal responsibility talk and ballooning debt under administrations of both parties.
  
- **Housing Affordability**: How acknowledgment of the housing crisis has not translated to effective policy responses at scale.
  
- **Wealth Gap**: The disparity between middle-class promises and policies that have favored the already wealthy.

## üî¨ Key Findings

Our research reveals several important patterns:

1. **Trust Deficit**: Only about 22% of Americans trust the federal government to do the right thing most of the time, near historic lows.

2. **Partisan Gridlock**: Both parties contribute to the rhetoric-action gap through resistance to compromise and prioritizing scoring political points.

3. **Special Interest Influence**: Lobbying from industries like healthcare, finance, and real estate often waters down promised reforms.

4. **Budget Constraints**: Bold promises often meet the reality of limited budgets, forcing politicians to scale back commitments.

5. **Proactive Solutions**: Rebuilding trust requires transparency about constraints, setting realistic expectations, establishing clear metrics, and publicly tracking progress.
